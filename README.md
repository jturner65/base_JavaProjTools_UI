# base_JavaProjTools_UI
UI functionality and utilities I use in all my java projects

These packages contain code I wrote that I use in nearly all of my java projects.  Functionality I have written governing openGL access, window and UI object definition and building and drawn curves and splines;  the compiled jar of this project should always include the source code for easy reference.  

Originally this project included other functionality that has since been moved to separate libraries : 

https://github.com/jturner65/base_JavaProjTools_Utils
https://github.com/jturner65/base_JavaProjTools_Sim
https://github.com/jturner65/base_JavaProjTools_Math

The immediate plans for the functionality this project covers are : 
--- Expand the IRenderInterface to describe the complete expectation of rendering functionality that any project using these libraries should meet
